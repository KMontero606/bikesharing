# bikesharing

## Overview of Project:
There is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. One of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis in order to solidify the proposal.

For this analysis, Pandas was used to modify the dataset procured from NYC CitiBike for the month of August. Then, the converted datatype was utilized to create a set of visualizations to:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, these visualizations along with two others were created for the final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

### Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
#1. Create the Checkout Times for Users Viz:

How long bikes are checked out for all genders. The most common users are male.

#3. Create the Trips by Weekday for Each Hour Viz:
<img width="948" alt="Trips by Weekday per Hour" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106962921/190652202-1d845435-531c-4e11-b0ce-9bc51461ecd6.png">

How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week for all riders. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday are the most trips taken during the morning and late afternoon.

#4. Create the Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) Viz:
<img width="950" alt="Trips by Gender" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106962921/190652666-969b041e-4fcd-4eb5-9df0-208d4ce4840c.png">
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week for all genders. The most common trips taken are from the male population.

#5. Create the User Trips by Gender by Weekday Viz:
<img width="949" alt="User Trips Gender Weekday" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106962921/190652957-028a99c1-daac-4e35-994b-d49987a7faf6.png">

A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender. Male Subscribers are more likely to check out a bike at the beginning and end of the week. 

### Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
The NYC CitiBike story was built using [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karen.montero/viz/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge_16630730954770/NYCCitiBikeforAugust2019#2).

## Summary:
There are over 2 million trips taken that utilizes the CitiBike service in the month of August, a perfect weather condition for bike riding. With the number of bike users, majority are from men than women although there are a number of unknown users who may not want to identify with either gender. There are more trips taken in the late afternoon than in the morning for no more than an hour during Monday, Tuesday and more heavily on Thursday than Friday given that Friday would be more ideal since it is the beginning of the weekend. The male population are more likely to go on more trips than the female population and male subscribers account for majority of the users of the CitiBike service. Over the course of these trips, one must take into account bike repairs to ensure the safety of our users as well as longevity of the bikes.

Additional visualization can be performed for future analysis. One such analysis would be at what age group do bike users fall into that utilizes the CitiBike service. With this information, we can determine if different sizes of bikes, types of bikes, are needed to accomodate certain age group i.e. for family with children going on bike rides together or riders who partake in marathon.

Another analysis that would be helpful would be
